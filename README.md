# Ellehacks_2024 Project
Our project aims to revolutionize the way we predict and prepare for power outages, ultimately minimizing their impact on communities. Inspired by the need for more effective outage management, we set out to harness the power of Machine Learning (ML) to predict outages based on weather patterns.
